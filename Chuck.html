  Charles Lindbergh "Chuck" McGill, Jr. is an Irish-American corporate lawyer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the co-founder and named partner of Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM), one of Albuquerque's most prestigious law firms. He is the older brother of criminal defence lawyer and convicted criminal Jimmy McGill, and the ex-husband of Rebecca Bois.

<p>
Chuck is a highly intelligent and dedicated lawyer who views the law as being sacred, and is very determined in helping his clients in any way possible. He founded HHM with George Hamlin and George's son Howard, and is well respected by his colleagues at HHM and other prestigious law firms. However, by 2001, Chuck began to claim to suffer from electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), essentially an adverse physical reaction to electrical devices, which make it challenging for him to lead a normal life. After Chuck steps away from HHM due to his claim of electromagnetic hypersensitivity, Howard enables him to work from home while Jimmy takes care of Chuck's personal needs.

Despite Jimmy admiring his older brother and initially believing him to be supportive of him as a lawyer, Chuck reveals to greatly resent his brother for his past actions as a conman, and believes him to be completely unfit to be a lawyer. Chuck prevents Jimmy from being hired by HHM and proceeded to create a majority of the obstacles he faces early on in his career. Chuck has a tumultuous and complicated relationship with Jimmy, with the two brothers often not seeing eye to eye and Chuck having conflicting views on how he feels about Jimmy, and he is unintentionally largely responsible for turning Jimmy into the criminally-inclined lawyer Saul Goodman that he later becomes.
