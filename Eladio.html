  He first met Gustavo Fring in 1989, when Gus and his partner Max Arciniega proposed producing methamphetamine for the cartel. Unimpressed by their pitch, Eladio declined because the cartel preferred to continue distributing cocaine. After the meeting, Eladio had Hector execute Max as retaliation for manipulating him into a meeting, but spared Gus's life due to an unrevealed but powerful connection to Chile. He then forced Gus to work with the cartel under Eladio's terms, and Gus became the cartel's chief distributor in the American Southwest.

Following the deaths of Juan Bolsa and the Cousins, and Gus's subsequent establishment of the meth superlab, Eladio orders retribution through his henchman Gaff, who hijacks meth deliveries and kills some of Gus's operatives. Gus agrees to Eladio's demands—the formula for the blue meth, the services of a chemist, and a 50% share of the business—and travels to the cartel's superlab with Mike Ehrmantraut and Jesse Pinkman. After Jesse cooks a successful batch, Eladio invites them to a party at his villa attended by multiple capos, who toast their new business venture with a bottle of premium tequila supplied by Gus. Eladio chides Gus as someone who provides value to the organization, but periodically needs to be reminded of his place. The capos begin to collapse shortly after the toast, victims of the poison Gus put in the tequila. Eladio realizes that Gus, who vomited up some of the poisoned tequila soon after the toast, has betrayed him, but collapses dead into the swimming pool before he can take any action.
