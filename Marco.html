  Marco and Leonel Salamanca, commonly known as The Cousins, are twin brothers, deadly enforcers, and prolific hitmen for Don Eladio Vuente's drug cartel. As members of the Salamanca family, the two cousins are grandsons of Abuelita and the nephews of Hector Salamanca. Marco and Leonel also have three cousins who are involved in criminal activities: Tuco, Lalo, and Joaquin. The Cousins' austere, mechanical physicality and virtually non-verbal interaction makes them a fearsome presence and they kill without hesitation or emotion.
