  Hector Salamanca, also known as Don Hector and referred to as TÃ­o by his nephews, is the elderly don of the Cartel, and an associate of cartel boss Don Eladio Vuente and don Juan Bolsa. A member of the Salamanca family, Hector is the son of Abuelita, the uncle of twins Marco and Leonel, Lalo, and Tuco, and is the grandfather of Joaquin. He raised Tuco as a son, and taught him and his other nephews that family is everything, living by the creed himself. He is the second Salamanca family member to run their drug operation, following his nephew Tuco and was succeeded by his nephew Lalo. Though brutal, Hector is very loyal to his family and the cartel.
