  Eduardo "Lalo" Salamanca, also known by his cartel title Don Eduardo and his civilian alias Jorge De Guzman, is a Mexican-American distributor and a high-ranking member and don of the Cartel, alongside his uncle Hector Salamanca, their boss Eladio Vuente, and associate Juan Bolsa.
</p>
<p>
A member of the Salamanca family, Lalo is the grandson of Abuelita and one of Don Hector's nephews, having four cousins who are also involved in criminal activities within the Salamanca drug operation in the cartel: his main cousin and fellow distributor Tuco, his hitmen cousins Marco and Leonel, and his first cousin once removed who works as Eladio's bodyguard, Joaquin. He is also one of Saul Goodman's most notable criminal clients, with Saul subsequently receiving a lot more criminals seeking his services as a result of him being Lalo's lawyer.
</p>
<p>
Lalo is the third Salamanca family member to run their drug operation, following his uncle Hector and cousin Tuco. Unlike most other members of his family, Lalo is often cheerful and charismatic. But like them, he can also be brutally and remorselessly vicious. Lalo is the rival of Gustavo Fring, and eventually became his most formidable rival. Because of the rivalry between Gus and Hector, Lalo becomes dedicated to disrupting Gus' legitimate restaurant business Los Pollos Hermanos and Lavander√≠a Brillante, as well as his reputation with the cartel. Unlike his other rivals such as Walter White, Gus was highly fearful of Lalo due to his cunning and resilience.
