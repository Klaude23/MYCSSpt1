  Henry R. "Hank" Schrader is a high-ranking officer at the Albuquerque office of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), starting out as a DEA agent alongside his close friend and partner Steven Gomez, and later being promoted to Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the DEA (ASAC). Hank is the husband of Marie Schrader and the brother-in-law of Skyler and Walter White, as well as the uncle of Walter White Jr.. and Holly, having a close friendship with his nephew. As a DEA agent, Hank lead the investigations of the methamphetamine cook "Heisenberg" (unaware for over a year that he was actually his own brother-in-law), as well as Gustavo Fring and his drug empire. Hank is faced with numerous threats from the rival drug cartels which take a toll on his mental health, causing him to develop post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As a hobby, Hank home brews his own Schraderbr√§u beer, and also takes up mineral collecting. Despite his brashness, Hank is highly competent at his job and cares deeply about his family.
