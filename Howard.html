  Howard G. Hamlin is an American corporate lawyer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, best known as the owner and CEO of Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM), a large and respected law firm that originally established by Howard's father George and Chuck McGill, who later added Howard as one of the managing partners. When George died and Chuck became housebound as a result of his supposed electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), Howard became the firm's managing partner and senior partner. Howard's friendship with Chuck and privileged background prove to be a constant source of frustration for both Jimmy McGill and Kim Wexler, his former employees at the firm. Despite his feuds with the McGill brothers and Kim, Howard is a skilled and affluent lawyer, with HHM being one of the most respected firms in Albuquerque.
