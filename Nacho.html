  Ignacio "Nacho" Varga is a Mexican-American career criminal from Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the son of Manuel Varga. Calculating and intelligent, Nacho was formerly an employee at his father's shop A-Z Fine Upholstery before becoming affiliated with the Cartel. He became one of Tuco Salamanca's most trusted enforcers and later became the lieutenant of both Hector and Lalo Salamanca. Against his will, Nacho later became an informant to Gustavo Fring after being blackmailed by him. As his role in both the Cartel and Gus' drug operation began to amplify, Nacho became increasingly discouraged from the organizations as his affiliation with them put both his and his father's lives in danger.
